# Super Resolution with ESRGANs in Desktop Apps
> Building the UI with Qt (Qt Creator) and writing the

A desktop app built with Qt (PySide6) for super resolution with ESRGANs in TensorFlow

### Building executables with GitHub Actions

A GitHub workflow defined by `build_apps.yml` in `.build/workflows` is
used to build portable executables for Windows and Linux. It contains two jobs, that are 
identical but run on `windows-latest` and `ubuntu-latest` respectively using 
the `main.spec` file to build the executables.

The workflow is initiated manually and the artifacts (executables) are uploaded 
as a release with an increment in the version.
